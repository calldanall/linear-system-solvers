# linear-system-solvers
Linear system of equations solvers using MATLAB. The purpose of these is to showcase a high level of conceptual understanding and a basic  working knowledge of how to implement that understanding into code.

The cyclicRed.m is a function that utilizes cyclic reduction to recursively solve a large system of equations.

The functions Gauss.m, BlockThomas.m and BlockThomasLU.m are all different classical ways of solving a linear system of equations and included is a tester the verifies that the BlockThomas and BlockThomasLU functions work by comparing them to the verified Gauss function.
